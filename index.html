        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Computer science is the study of computers and computing, including the theoretical and algorithmic
            properties of hardware and software, and applications for information processing. The study of algorithms
            and data structures, computer and network design, the modeling of data and information processes, and
            artificial intelligence are all included in the field of computer science. Since mathematics and engineering
            provide some of the fundamentals for computer science, it integrates concepts from those fields as well as
            physics, probability and statistics, and electrical circuit design. Experimentation and hypothesis testing
            are also widely used in computer science for the conceptualization, design, evaluation, and improvement of
            new algorithms, information structures, and computer systems. </p>

        <h2>History of Computer Science</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The history of computer science dates back much further than the development of the field as we know it
            today, and it typically took the shape of mathematics or physics. Advancements in earlier ages led to the
            field of study that is now known as computer science. </p>
        <p>In 1837 Charles Babbage first described his Analytical Engine which is accepted as the first design for a
            modern computer. The analytical engine had expandable memory, an arithmetic unit, and logic processing
            capabilities able to interpret a programming language with loops and conditional branching. Although never
            built, the design has been studied extensively and is understood to be Turing equivalent. The analytical
            engine would have had a memory capacity of less than 1 kilobyte of memory and a clock speed of less than 10
            Hertz.</p>

        <h2>The Future of Computer Science (AI) </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capacity for thought and learning in a computer program or other system.
            Additionally, it is an area of study that aims to "smarten up" computers. They operate without being
            programmed with directives. In 1955, John McCarthy came up with the term "artificial intelligence. </p>
        <p>The phrase "artificial intelligence" generally refers to a program that imitates human intelligence Computers
            have the capability of performing at least some of the tasks that we identify with human brains, such as
            learning and problem-solving, though not quite in the same way. In more accurate yet understandable terms,
            artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a system's capacity to accurately read external input, to learn from
            that data, and to use that learning to accomplish certain goals and activities through adaptable change.</p>
        <p>One major example of AI is chatbots. Currently a new revolutionary chat bot hit the market, it's called
            Chat GPT. Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer[2]) is a chatbot
            created by OpenAI. It is constructed on top of the OpenAI GPT-3 family of big language models and has been
            improved (a method of transfer learning) by employing both supervised and reinforcement learning
            strategies. It quickly attracted attention for its thorough responses and clear solutions across numerous
            knowledge topics.</p>

        <h2>Wrap Up</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>It might be difficult to fully grasp the depth and breadth of computer science's influence due to its broad
            reach across society. Innovation in fields of science as disparate as vaccine development, environmental
            science, and quantum physics is fueled by computer science. Additionally, it influences economy, healthcare,
            as well as how we work, play, and connect in a variety of other ways. </p>
